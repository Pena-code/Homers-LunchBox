Game made in Java using SimpleGraphics(CodeforAll_) library.

It's lunch time in Springfield, and as usual, Homer is very hungry. 
Your task is to fill his LunchBox with his favorite food – Donuts! 
But remember, Homer’s belly won’t be satisfied with broccoli, and he can’t live without his Pink Donuts. Make sure you get it right!
